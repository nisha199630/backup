2. You can even see it on the photo you sent me. The red line covers up a bit of the READ MORE button but not the photo. Blow it up big and you will see.
https://prnt.sc/1qxh0hq  Done

4. Your point is noted. I didn't want the same colors; I was just showing you the layout. The search bar is a good start, but please make it look more like the sample I sent you. I want a "Go" button to the right like you see there. Can you do that? Also, the font where it says "SEARCH" on top is bigger than in the other sections. Please, please make everything consistent, not random. 

https://prnt.sc/1qxhkha ----DONE

5. Looks good. Now can you please use that same font size and spacing for the About the Author section?

https://prnt.sc/1qxhm83 -- DONE

6. Looks good. But please move the light blue down even more. It should be right in the middle.Also, please make the blue line the same length, horizontally, in every section. PLEASE BE CONSISTENT.
 
https://prnt.sc/1qxhm83 ---Done


9. The gray looks darker than in other section. Look at the gray background in the Trade Secret FAQs section on the Home page. Can you please match that?

https://prnt.sc/1qxhqnv  --- DONE

10. Good, but "Get in Touch" should be the same font style as the other sections on the Home page (Recent Posts, Trade Secret FAQs, etc.) 

https://prnt.sc/1qxhrph   ---- DONE

Please check and let me know your Feedback.
Thank you

1) Please put Master Vitamins together on one line. Should it be centered?
Done

2)We need the picture between the vitamin C and vitamin D. Maybe we should have all the pictures on top of the information that it is referencing for mobile
Done

3) Can we put some space between these two? Those pictures are for the top product and not the one beneath it.
Done

4) Those questions shouldn’t be there. That’s for the FAQ and that should show up on the drop-down button. Thanks so much for removing the functionality of the top word in the menu when it has a drop-down.

please check this video https://www.loom.com/share/b951744a7e7f4470975eb0c71edf82f5
if we click on menu icon its will displayed the menu items and after that click on cross button then menu itesm hidden but does not means Faqs functionality is not working.


5)Please update those areas with that font.
Done

6) this is the quote for 3 John 2:
Beloved, I pray that you may prosper in all things, and be in health, just as your soul prospers

Done

Footer / “Get in Touch”

3. Move the email address down just a pixel or two so the spacing is consistent.
https://prnt.sc/1r3qfqn  Done
4. Where it says “Copyright © Maxwell Goss,” there should be no link embedded in “Maxwell Goss” 
Done

Home
“What We Do”

5. I had you remove the arrows in the boxes and on the right and left. You did – bit
now they are back! Please take them back out!
Done

About Maxwell Goss

6. Why doesn’t the link to this page in the menu work?
   Added Page in About Maxwell Goss

7. Where it says “About Maxwell Goss,” please use the exact same font type, size,weight that you use on other pages, e.g., Legal Services.
Done
8. Please SAVE this page.
Done
9. Then, on a different page, try a bio page with just a white background, maybe
something like this: https://cartwrightlaw.com/attorney/robert-e-cartwright-jr/ (but
without the Super Lawyers icon and other crap at the top)

What Clients Say

10. At the top, say “What Clients Say,” not “What Clients are Saying”
https://prnt.sc/1r3qwf1 Done

11. At the bottom, there are three little round buttons: 
https://www.loom.com/share/29ded9d7880f4321a40f7c27f253d5a1  Done

13. We are having a real disconnect over those light blue lines.   Done
a. Please do them like this: https://prnt.sc/1r3ssn3  Done
b. Also, please move the blue lines downward more. Here I want it exactly in
the middle between “Categories” and “All.” (And the same in the other
boxes.)  
https://prnt.sc/1r3ssn3 Done
 
14. Search: I see you squared the corners of the “Go” button. Great! Now can you
square the corners of the search box?
https://prnt.sc/1r3sy3j Done
15. When one clicks through to a blog entry, the title of the post wraps around in a
weird way, like this:
a. Can you make it so that “Display” continues right after “Shareholder,”
without wrapping around (unless the screen is small)?
https://prnt.sc/1r3t57u  Done

b. Please let me know if this does not make sense.
